# Discord Music Bot

Discord Music Bot is a simple Discord bot created using the Python programming language. The bot allows users to play music in Discord servers and can play music in voice chat channels using a custom command.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a new bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
4. Copy the bot token and add it to the `config.py` file.
5. Run the bot using `python bot.py`.

## Usage

To use the bot, join a voice channel in a Discord server and type the command `!play [url]` in a text channel. Replace `[url]` with the URL of a YouTube video or a music file. The bot will then join the voice channel and start playing the music.

To stop the music, simply type the command `!stop` in the text channel.
